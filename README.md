# Alice 2.4 Extended Source Project (AXSP)
A project that aims to take a forked version of Alice 2.2 and:
- [x] Reformat the code to look nicer.
- [x] Update the Java environment to Java 7.
- [ ] Remove as many code warnings as possible (just 3000 to go!).
- [ ] Update the code to match the Alice 2.4 source code.

__________

The Alice 2.4 source code has not been made public, 
however we can work it out:
- [x] Take original Alice 2.2 source code from first commit of this repository.
- [x] Compile the code to a jar.
- [x] Download the latest Alice 2.4 source code.
- [x] Get the alice.jar out of it.
- [x] Use JD-GUI (Java Decompiler) to decompile each jar to a folder.
- [x] Ensure JD-GUI had line and meta comments turned off in preferences.
- [x] Open both decompiled sources as Eclipse projects.
- [x] Use Eclipse to format entire source code for each project.
- [x] Use Meld (file diffing tool) on both project folders.
- [x] See what has been updated in Alice 2.4.
- [ ] Add new files to this source code.
- [ ] Apply all remaining changes.

** I need this code for a small project of mine (that may never actually see the light of day). **
